# Password-Generator
I established the variables to be confirmed by the user

Then I created an array for each variable to define the characters that would be available for the passwords. I know that the symbols could have more but I decided to limit the characters.

Aftter, I created the function that would generate the password. I created a while loop to ensure that the user selects a number of characters between 8 and 128. I decided to add an alert to notify the user if they selected the correct number of characters. I also included a confirmation alert to notify the user the length of the password. 
 

The if loops concat the variable into the password if the user elects to include the variable.
